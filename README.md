# Welcome to [project name]

[Intro to project]

# Files

The **frontend** folder contains all the code relevant to the Reactjs frontend for the app

Similarly, the **api** folder holds all the code to handle the python flask backend

# Prerequisites

Before being able to run the project, there are a few things we need to do.

1. [copy local env when set up]
2. In your env file, you will need to populate the STRAVA_REFRESH_TOKEN variable with the refresh token relevant to your account. To do this I would suggest you follow the steps lined out in the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgscChKfGyg&t=17s)
3. Install yarn etc?

# Running the app

You will need two terminal tabs open, with both being in the frontend directory

In the first tab run the command ```yarn start``` to run the react frontend

In the second tab run the command ```start-api``` to run the flask backend

Finally, direct your browser to ```localhost:3000``` and you should be in!
